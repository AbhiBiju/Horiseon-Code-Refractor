# Code Refactor Starter Code

In this challenge, I refactored the Horiseon website HTML and CSS code so that it is made more accessible and the webpage is easily read by assistive technologies like screen readers for the vision impaired.

The deployed application can be found at: <https://abhibiju.github.io/Horiseon-Code-Refractor/>
